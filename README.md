> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

#### What can be done with Python?
- General Web Development
- Scientific Computing / Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Automation and Scripting
- Web Scraping
- build games

#### Install Python:
To install Python, follow these steps:
- Navigate to the Python downloads page: Python [downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Click on the link/button to download Python 3.x or Python 2.7
- Follow the installation instructions.
- Open your terminal again and type the command python. The Python interpreter should respond with the version number.

e.g. on windows:
````text
Python 3.7.4 (tags/v3.7.4:e09359112e, Jul  8 2019, 20:34:20) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
````

#### How to do "Hello world" in Python?
```python
# this is a comment
print("Hello World")
```

#### Variables
````python
number = 10  # This a variable
````
````python
PI = 3.14159  # This is a constant
````

#### Data type
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Category | Data type
----------|----------
Text Type |	[str](https://github.com/addleonel/python-fundamentals/blob/master/lecture_1/data_type.py)
Numeric Types |[int](https://github.com/addleonel/python-fundamentals/blob/master/lecture_1/data_type.py), [float](https://github.com/addleonel/python-fundamentals/blob/master/lecture_1/data_type.py), complex
Boolean Type|	[bool](https://github.com/addleonel/python-fundamentals/blob/master/lecture_1/data_type.py)
Sequence Types| [list](https://github.com/addleonel/python-fundamentals/blob/master/lecture_1/data_type.py), [tuple](https://github.com/addleonel/python-fundamentals/blob/master/lecture_1/data_type.py), range
Mapping Type|	[dict](https://github.com/addleonel/python-fundamentals/blob/master/lecture_1/data_type.py)
Set Types|	[set](https://github.com/addleonel/python-fundamentals/blob/master/lecture_1/data_type.py), frozenset
Binary Types|	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

Primitive data structures | Non-primitive data structures
-------------------------| -----------------------------
