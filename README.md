> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

#### What can be done with Python?
- General Web Development

#### Install Python:
To install Python, follow these steps:
- Navigate to the Python downloads page: Python [downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Click on the link/button to download Python 3.x or Python 2.7
